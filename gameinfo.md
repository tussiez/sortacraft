## Known Bugs  
 - Every once in a while, chunk sides don't update correctly (leaves space)  
 - You can partially glitch into a block, can see thru  
 - Walking into unloaded chunks causes game to freeze until chunk is loaded  
 - Game locks up when building above y64
 - Occasionally the shadowmap breaks when placing/breaking lights frequently, causing the darkened area to partially illuminate.  
 - Most likely unfixable, ores spawn floating  
 - Sometimes a tree log spawns at y64  
 - Partial glitch into block while jumping
 - Corner Jump:Jump near the corner of a block that's @ player height(e.g standing on a block next to a tree) and jumping causes you to get stuck inside
