- Make sure that when we store the data, we store the original data so that if the block is replaced with the original type of block we don't have to save it anymore (because the seed takes care of that). Also, make sure you tell when a block is placed/broken during gameplay so that we can store the data afterwards.
- Also there is a possible problem with having a player go to a chunk that is of a great distance away from another chunk that needs to be loaded during loading a game from a save string, but I believe that can be taken care of due to data being stored even when not loaded.
- When making the ability to render glass and other transparent objects, we need program it in such a way where it won't render transparency specific to the texture - especially when we add texture packs. Rather, we need to make sure any transparency in any block is rendered correctly. This is to ensure that texture packs created by the user can render holes in a block efficiently and without flaws compared to an original texture pack.
