## Known Bugs/Issues  
 - Every once in a while, chunk sides don't update correctly (leaves space)  
 - You can partially glitch into a block, can see thru  
 - Walking into unloaded chunks causes game to freeze until chunk is loaded  
 - Sometimes a tree log spawns at y64  
 - Partial glitch into block while jumping
 - Corner Jump:Jump near the corner of a block that's @ player height(e.g standing on a block next to a tree) and jumping causes you to get stuck inside
