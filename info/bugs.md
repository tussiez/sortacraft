# Bugs
- Fly mode takes three space bar presses instead of two.
- Options and inventory window takes two taps the first time opening to open instead of two.
- Trying to break/place in a chunk that isn't loaded causes an error.
- Sometimes going near a chunk that isn't loaded causes an error 

# Solutions
- Use similar gravity "acceleration" for FOV
- Update "first" keypress on keydown?
