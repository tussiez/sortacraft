# Security/Error reporting Policy

## Supported Versions
Our project only provides security bug/error patching with each game version update. To ensure security bugs are no more, please update to the lastest stable version of sortacraft (hosted at https://tussiez.github.io/sortacraft).

## Reporting a Vulnerability/Error
What to post:
- The version of the game
- File the bug happened in (if given an explicit error)
- A detailed description of the bug/error
- Recent events leading up to the bug (if you can provide such details)
- The browser you are using (and browser version if possible)

Security bugs/Errors will be handled either by Tussiez or JavaXSScript. Depending on the severity of the situation, we may or may not respond quickly. Note that we are working on sortacraft almost daily (as of late January 2021) and are attempting to provide the best performance, security and overall pleasant game experience as we can.

## What counts as an error/security bug?
- An explicit console error given during playing the game
- A bug that has the ability to compromise the client's device and/or the hosting provider
- Any weird gameplay (like a glitch) that just doesn't feel right (if have feedback about improving the game then you may open an issue)
